# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "kabu" repository (Japanese for "stock"), which appears to be a minimal starter project. The repository currently contains only basic files (README.md, LICENSE) and is ready for initial development.

## Current State

- **Language/Framework**: Not yet determined
- **Project Structure**: Minimal - only README and LICENSE files exist
- **Build System**: Not yet implemented
- **Testing**: Not yet implemented

## Development Notes

This repository is in its initial state with only a README and MIT license. When adding code:

1. Determine the primary language/framework for the project
2. Set up appropriate build and dependency management tools
3. Establish testing framework
4. Update this CLAUDE.md with specific build, test, and development commands

## Next Steps

This CLAUDE.md should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established to include:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Development setup instructions
- Code architecture details
